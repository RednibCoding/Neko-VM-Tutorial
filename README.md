# Overview

## What is Neko?

[Neko](http://nekovm.org/index) is a language intended to be used to implement other languages, particularly high-level, dynamic languages. Neko comes with its own virtual machine, runtime, and libraries. It is an excellent way to quickly implement languages without having to worry too much about low-level details.

## What is this tutorial?

Although Neko is easy to work with, the sparsity of the documentation makes it somewhat difficult to get started. Hopefully, this tutorial can help people get up to speed and working with Neko in a short amount of time, as well as providing a bit more exposure for the language.
