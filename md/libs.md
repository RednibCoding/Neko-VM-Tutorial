## Importing from C Libraries

The standard libraries and the libraries shipped with Neko (e.g., Regexp) are C libraries with an API layer to interact with Neko. The difference between these libraries and modules written in Neko is only in how they are imported.

Importing from a library looks like this:

```js
$loader.loadprim("[library]@[function]", num_arguments);
```

For example, to load the `file_open` function from the standard library, which takes two arguments, the call would be:

```js
var open = $loader.loadprim("std@file_open", 2);
```

The imported function can then be used like any other function.

Similarly, if one wished to import the `regexp_new` function from the Regexp library, one would do:

```js
var new_reg = $loader.loadprim("regexp@regexp_new", 1);
```
